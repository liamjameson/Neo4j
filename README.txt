This is an example of a Neo4j project I have done for one of my
Computer Science courses. This repo should contain all the required
materials in order for you to run this program. Please follow the
instructions below for an exmaple that is found pre-installed on
Neo4j

**Installation Neo4j and run a demo**

Requires JDK 8 (or higher).

Download Neo4j SERVER Community Version 3.3.5 from https://neo4j.com/download/. Uncompress it in a folder of your choice, say Neo4j.

To start the server, navigate to the working directory of your Neo4j Server Community Version 3.3.5.
Then use the following commands for your OS type.
 * Windows, use: bin\Neo4j.bat
 * Linux/Mac, use: ./bin/neo4j console

Access Neo4j server by using http://localhost:7474/

Initially the user name and pass word are both "neo4j". On first use you will be asked to change the password. 
    -> If you are using my version of Neo4j that I have provided in this repo then the password is: password

Tip: You can use Ctrl+C to stop the server. Also, from the command line you can use command "neo4j start" to start, "neo4j restart" to restart, or "neo4j stop" to stop the server. 

At the top left corner, click the star button.

Then scroll down your curser to find the sample Movie Graph database learn about how to write cypher query.

To start a demo, click on [Movie Graph]. You will enter a self-guided tutorial to help you load data and execute queries.

The tutorial can be followed by (a) clicking a right arrow in a circle to display commands, (b) click in commands area to load the commands in the console for execution, then (c) in order to execute commands, click on a triangular arrow in a circle on the right side of the console. Repeat this cycle (a), (b), (c).


NOTE:
When you execute commands the changes to the databases in the context become permanent.
If you repeat commands, the same data may get loaded twice
Play with the icon consisting of three circles on the top left corner and see what happens.
When a graph or rows are displayed, click on Graph and Rows icons to observe what happens.
To close the session you must click on the [Stop] button on the Neo4 Community dialog box.
